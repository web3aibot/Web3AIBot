<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-12-24</p>

<p>
  This Privacy Policy explains how <b>Web3 AI Reply</b> (“we”, “our”, “the Extension”)
  collects, uses, stores, and shares information when you use our Chrome extension on
  <b>x.com</b> / <b>twitter.com</b>.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Extension operates on X/Twitter pages and provides one-click actions such as generating replies and liking posts.</li>
  <li>The Extension’s UI uses <code>sidePanel</code>, and preferences are stored locally using <code>chrome.storage</code>.</li>
  <li>To generate AI replies, your submitted text and required public tweet context are sent to our backend and then to our AI provider (<b>Groq</b>) to generate a response.</li>
  <li>We do not collect your X/Twitter password, do not access your private messages (DMs), and do not sell personal data.</li>
  <li>Minimal security/operational logs (e.g., timestamps, error codes, IP address, user-agent) may be processed for abuse prevention and reliability.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Scope & roles</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Controller / Provider:</b> Web3 AI Reply</li>
  <li>The Extension runs on <b>x.com</b> and <b>twitter.com</b> pages. Content scripts load on matching pages, but features are performed only when you initiate actions in the Extension UI.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Information we collect / process</h2>

<h3>1) User-provided content</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tweet URLs you paste, select, or submit.</li>
  <li>Text you submit for AI reply generation (including any prompt/settings you provide).</li>
  <li>Optional feedback you type into the Extension UI.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2) Public page context (X/Twitter)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Publicly visible tweet text, author handle, and visible metadata needed to generate a reply or perform an action you request (e.g., like/reply on a specific tweet).</li>
  <li>The current page URL and the specific tweet URL you are interacting with.</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">
  We do not access your private messages (DMs) and do not read content unrelated to your requested action.
</p>

<h3>3) Local extension storage</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Settings and preferences you configure in the Extension.</li>
  <li>Stored locally via <code>chrome.storage</code> to persist behavior across sessions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4) Account, authentication, credits (if enabled)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Email address (to identify your account).</li>
  <li>Auth/session tokens (to keep you signed in).</li>
  <li>Credit balance, credit usage, and transaction status (to provide credits-based functionality).</li>
</ul>

<h3>5) Technical & security data (minimal)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Request timestamps, basic diagnostics (error codes/messages), and extension version.</li>
  <li>IP address and user-agent may appear in standard server logs for security, rate limiting, and abuse prevention.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Information we do NOT collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Your X/Twitter password.</li>
  <li>Your private messages (DMs).</li>
  <li>Your full browsing history (beyond the active tab URL required to run your requested action).</li>
  <li>Personal data for advertising or resale.</li>
  <li>Sensitive personal data unless you explicitly type it into a prompt yourself.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>How we use information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To generate AI replies and perform actions you explicitly request (e.g., prepare a reply, like a tweet).</li>
  <li>To store your preferences and keep the Extension functional.</li>
  <li>To authenticate users and manage credits (if enabled).</li>
  <li>To prevent abuse, ensure stability, troubleshoot issues, and debug errors.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Permissions & why they are needed</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>storage</code>:
    to store your settings and preferences locally using <code>chrome.storage</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>sidePanel</code>:
    to display the Extension UI in the Chrome side panel.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>tabs</code>:
    to read the active tab URL (e.g., the tweet/page you are interacting with) so the Extension can run your requested action on the correct X/Twitter page, and to coordinate the side panel UI with the active tab.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Host permission</b>:
    <code>https://us-central1-web3-ai-reply.cloudfunctions.net/api/*</code>
    — to communicate with our backend API endpoint when needed (e.g., AI reply generation, authentication/credits if enabled).
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Third-party services & sharing</h2>
<p>
  We share data <b>only as necessary</b> to provide the features you explicitly request.
  We do not sell personal data and we do not share data for advertising purposes.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>1) Backend API (Google Cloud / Firebase Cloud Functions)</b><br />
    Endpoint: <code>https://us-central1-web3-ai-reply.cloudfunctions.net/api/*</code><br />
    We may send the tweet URL, required public tweet context, and your selected settings/prompt to this endpoint
    to generate replies and provide features such as authentication or credits (if enabled).<br />
    As part of hosting and operating this backend, Google Cloud/Firebase may process data as our infrastructure provider
    (including operational logging/monitoring).
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>2) AI Provider (Groq)</b><br />
    To generate AI replies, our backend forwards the text you submit (prompt/settings) and the minimum required public tweet context to <b>Groq</b> for processing and response generation.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>3) X (Twitter) / x.com</b><br />
    When you choose to post a reply or like a tweet, those actions occur on the X website in your browser. X receives the submitted reply content and the like action as part of normal platform operation.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>4) Payment processor (only if you sell credits/subscriptions)</b><br />
    If payments are enabled, we may share necessary billing data with our payment processor to complete transactions. We do not store full payment card details.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="muted">
  Third-party services process data under their own policies. We only share the minimum data needed to provide the Extension’s functionality.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Remote code</h2>
<p>
  The Extension does not download or execute remote JavaScript/Wasm code at runtime. All executable logic is bundled within the Extension package.
  The Extension communicates with external services only to send user-requested input and receive response data.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Data retention</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Local data:</b> stored on your device until you clear extension data or uninstall.</li>

  <li>
    <b>AI prompts and generated replies:</b> we do <b>not</b> store the prompts you submit or the AI-generated replies in our database. They are processed transiently to fulfill your request.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Account/credits data (if enabled):</b> retained while your account is active and as needed to provide credits-based functionality.
    You may request deletion of account-related data, subject to limited retention required for legal, security, or fraud-prevention purposes.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Logs (security/operations):</b> minimal operational logs (e.g., timestamps, error codes, IP address, user-agent) may be retained for up to <b>30 days</b> for security, abuse prevention, and troubleshooting,
    then rotated/deleted.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
  We use HTTPS/TLS and reasonable safeguards to protect data in transit and at rest.
  While no system is 100% secure, we apply standard measures such as access controls and least-privilege practices.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Your choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You may uninstall the Extension at any time.</li>
  <li>You can clear stored settings via Chrome extension controls.</li>
  <li>You may request deletion of account-related backend data by contacting us.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
<p>
  The Extension is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country).
  We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
</p>

<hr />
